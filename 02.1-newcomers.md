## GitHub
Put your work in a public repository! This allows others to see your work-in-progress and follow each change you make real time. [GitHub](http://github.com/) thrives at distributed collaboration and has a built in public discussion forum in their issue tracker.
* version control. Collaboration.

## README.md
The text you place in README.md is often a user's first introduction to a project -- especially if the project is hosted on GitHub. Make sure you create a welcoming README that gives an overview of your project.

Leading with a clear and concise mission statement will help the community understand what you're building. Keeping it short and simple will help others quickly understand and decide if they want to be a part of this project.
