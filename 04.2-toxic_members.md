# Toxic Members

// rewrite this stuff copied from - https://etherpad.mozilla.org/Portland-Community-Building

Retention
* why participate in our projects vs. another one?
    * corollary:  response to mocking sends message to what is acceptable
* need a code of conduct for events (that's another discussion)
* we're pretty good at this, but we can be a lot better at this
    * Q: if toxic interaction occurs on bugzilla, is it better to address in public or offline?
    * A: need to deal with bad actors in public. if we deal privately, need to make sure it's visible that we dealt with it privately.
* toxic members have a huge impact: actively mocking, condescending
    * "This is what I think about what you did." Don't just come in and poop on it. You can then go back in the bug and say "This other person didn't do X; here's the X that was expected."
    * do a quick feedback loop without shaming that person
* Some communities have active, contributing member with toxic behaviours who refuses to address behaviour. Often large belief in * meritocracy, can fragment the community.
    * If you fragment, make sure all toxic people on one side. Alternative to excising bad actor is community falls apart.
    * How to excise without alienating people who don't see bad behaviour, just good contributor being treated badly?
    * Paper trail. Show attempts to deal with behaviour in past.
* The person with the most authority in a room. How that person acts sends a very clear message to the rest of the community of * what's accepted. If that's you, you need to step up.
