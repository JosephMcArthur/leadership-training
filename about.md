# Edit this Book

This book is produced using a hacked up [version](https://github.com/davidascher/gitbook/tree/webmaker-styling) of [Gitbook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook) (hacked so that the styling is more in line with build.webmaker.org).

To edit the content, just edit or create new markdown files in the [github repo](https://github.com/MozillaScience/leadership-training/).  On git push to the `master` (default) branch.

For through-the-web usage, you can either use the Github editor, or [prose.io](http://prose.io/#MozillaScience/leadership-training)

This version of Gitbook only supports markdown files, but I believe you can have HTML embedded in markdown files.

Feedback [welcome](https://github.com/MozillaScience/leadership-training/issues/).
