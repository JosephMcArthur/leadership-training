# Project Setup

This section will outline some best practices for setting up a new project in a way that encourages participation.

* [GitHub](02.1-newcomers.md): Make your work publicly accessible.
* [README.md](02.1-newcomers.md#README.md): Describe your project. This will be most users first impression.
* [Issues](02.1-newcomers.md#good-first-bugs): Tease out some tasks for new contributors to jump in.
* [Roadmap](02.2-roadmap.md): What is the current state of your project? What will you be doing next?
* [Open license](02.3-legal.md): Make sure your project is open and ready for community contributions
* [Project Checklist](02.4-checklist.md)
