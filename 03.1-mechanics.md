## CONTRIBUTING.md
Jumping into a new project can be hard and intimidating. Lower the friction to join in by having contributor guidelines (usually in a CONTRIBUTING.md file, linked from the README). This document will help others understand the way your community works and how you interact with each other.

Good questions to address in contributor guidelines:

* How do I report a bug?
* How do I set up my development environment?
* How do I submit changes to the code base?
* **Where can I ask for help?** - make sure you point users to an IRC channel / forum / email address that will be responsive and welcoming to newcomers.
