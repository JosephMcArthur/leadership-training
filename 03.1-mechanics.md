## CONTRIBUTING.md
Jumping into a new project can be hard and intimidating. Help lower the friction for new developers by having contributor guidelines (usually in a CONTRIBUTING.md file). This document will help others understand the way your community works and how you interact with each other.

Questions the contributor guidelines should address:
* How do I report a bug?
* How do I set up my development environment?
* How do I submit changes to the code base?
* Where can I ask for help?
